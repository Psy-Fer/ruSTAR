# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Git Workflow

**DO NOT commit changes automatically.** The user will review, test, and commit changes themselves. Claude should:
- Make code changes as requested
- Suggest what should be committed
- Let the user handle `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`

## Project Overview

ruSTAR is a Rust reimplementation of [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference), an RNA-seq aligner originally written in C++ by Alexander Dobin. Licensed under MIT to match the original STAR license.

The primary goal is a faithful port — matching the original STAR behavior as closely as possible. Extra features and divergences from the original will come in later releases/forks. When implementing, refer to the [STAR source code](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) to ensure correctness and behavioral parity.

## Build Commands

Rust 2024 edition. Standard Cargo commands:

```bash
cargo build            # Debug build
cargo build --release  # Release build
cargo test             # Run all tests
cargo test <name>      # Run a single test by name
cargo clippy           # Lint
cargo fmt              # Format code
```

Always run `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo test` before considering a phase complete.

## Current Status

**264 tests passing.** SE: 97.4% position agreement, 97.6% CIGAR, 3.0% splice rate, 57 shared junctions. PE: 95.6% per-mate position, 9017 pairs (0 unmapped). See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed phase tracking and [docs/](docs/) for per-phase notes.

## Development Philosophy — Match STAR Exactly

**Never backtrack on changes that make the method closer to STAR's logic, even if metrics temporarily regress.** A regression in alignment statistics (position agreement, splice rate, etc.) after making the code more STAR-faithful does NOT mean the change was wrong — it means the implementation is incomplete. More STAR-matching changes are needed to close the gap.

- It is better to go backwards in metrics temporarily to eventually reach 100% matching results, than to keep approximate methods that can never get there.
- Every algorithm, threshold, and code path should match STAR's C++ source exactly. Any deviation — even a small one — should be corrected.
- Do not revert STAR-faithful changes. Instead, investigate what STAR does differently in the surrounding logic and implement that too.
- When a STAR-matching change causes regression, the response is: "What else does STAR do that we don't?" — not "revert and try something different."

## Key Conventions

- **Crate name is `ruSTAR`** — `#![allow(non_snake_case)]` in lib.rs suppresses the crate name warning
- **STAR params use `--camelCase` naming** — clap `#[arg(long = "camelCase")]` maps to snake_case Rust fields
- **Multi-value params** (genomeFastaFiles, readFilesIn, outSAMtype, outSAMattributes, chimOutType, alignSJstitchMismatchNmax, outSJfilterIntronMaxVsReadN) need explicit `num_args`
- **Negative defaults** (scoreGapNoncan=-8, readMapNumber=-1, etc.) need `allow_hyphen_values = true`
- **`outSAMtype`** is parsed as raw `Vec<String>` then structured via `Parameters::out_sam_type()` method
- **Validation** beyond clap's type checking is in `Parameters::validate()` (e.g. genomeGenerate requires FASTA files)
- **No async** — CPU-bound work; async adds complexity with zero benefit
- **Error handling** — `thiserror` for `Error` enum, `anyhow` for top-level result propagation

```

## Testing Pattern

- Unit tests: `#[cfg(test)]` in each module
- Integration tests: `tests/` directory (future phases)
- Every phase uses differential testing against STAR where applicable
- Test data tiers: synthetic micro-genome → chr22 → full human genome

**Current test status**: 264/264 tests passing (260 unit + 4 integration), non-critical clippy warnings (too_many_arguments x 7, type_complexity x 1, manual_contains x 1, implicit_saturating_sub x 1)

## Known Issues (Top 3)

1. **Splice rate 3.0% vs STAR 2.2%** — method deviations: MMP SA range overestimation (extend_match only narrows sa_start), 200-seed cap (STAR uses seedPerWindowNmax=50 during window assignment), single transcript per window (STAR's recursive DP produces multiple)
2. **rDNA MAPQ inflation** (~133 reads, MAPQ 255 vs STAR 1-3) — root cause: single transcript per window → MAPQ=255. STAR's recursive DP produces multiple transcripts → low MAPQ
3. **BySJout too aggressive without GTF** — all junctions novel → strict thresholds

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [docs/](docs/) for full issue tracking.

## Remaining Limitations (Top 5)

- No coordinate-sorted BAM output (use `samtools sort`) — Phase 17.2
- No PE chimeric detection — Phase 17.3
- No `--quantMode GeneCounts` — Phase 17.8
- No `--outStd SAM/BAM` (stdout output) — Phase 17.6
- No STARsolo single-cell features — Phase 14 (deferred)
