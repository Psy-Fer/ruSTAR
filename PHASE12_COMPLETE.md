# Phase 12.2 Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETE: Chimeric Detection Integration

Phase 12 is now fully functional for single-end reads!

### What Was Implemented (Phase 12.2)

**Integration into end-to-end pipeline** (~100 lines modified in `src/lib.rs`):

1. **Created helper struct** to hold both SAM records and chimeric alignments:
   ```rust
   struct AlignmentBatchResults {
       sam_records: BufferedSamRecords,
       chimeric_alns: Vec<ChimericAlignment>,
   }
   ```

2. **Modified parallel processing** in `align_reads_single_end()`:
   - Parallel workers now collect chimeric alignments alongside SAM records
   - Changed return type from `Vec<BufferedSamRecords>` to `Vec<AlignmentBatchResults>`
   - Chimeric alignments collected when `chimSegmentMin > 0`

3. **Added chimeric writer lifecycle**:
   - Create `ChimericJunctionWriter` at alignment start if enabled
   - Write chimeric alignments after each batch (sequential, in read order)
   - Flush chimeric output at end of alignment

4. **Added paired-end infrastructure**:
   - Chimeric writer created for paired-end mode (ready for future implementation)
   - Warning logged that paired-end chimeric detection not yet implemented

### Files Modified

- `src/lib.rs`: ~100 lines (integration into parallel alignment pipeline)

### Testing

- ✅ All 170 tests passing
- ✅ 4 non-critical clippy warnings (unchanged)
- ✅ Code formatted with `cargo fmt`
- ✅ Release build successful

### Total Phase 12 Code

- **Phase 12.1**: ~900 lines (core detection infrastructure)
- **Phase 12.2**: ~100 lines (pipeline integration)
- **Total**: ~1000 lines

### Usage

Enable chimeric detection with:
```bash
./target/release/ruSTAR \
  --runMode alignReads \
  --genomeDir /path/to/index \
  --readFilesIn reads.fq \
  --outFileNamePrefix output/ \
  --chimSegmentMin 15 \
  --chimScoreMin 10
```

Output: `output/Chimeric.out.junction` (14-column STAR-compatible format)

### What Works Now

✅ **Single-end chimeric detection**:
- Inter-chromosomal fusions (chr9→chr22)
- Intra-chromosomal strand breaks (chr1:+→chr1:-)
- Large-distance breaks (>1Mb same chr/strand)
- Soft-clip based detection (>20% clipped)

✅ **Output**: STAR-compatible Chimeric.out.junction file

✅ **Junction classification**: GT/AG, CT/AC, GC/AG, etc.

### Known Limitations

❌ **Paired-end chimeric detection**: Infrastructure ready, detection logic not implemented

❌ **Tier 3 re-mapping**: Soft-clipped sequences not re-searched (computationally expensive)

❌ **Integration tests**: No synthetic fusion test data yet

### Next Steps (per roadmap: A→C→B)

**C: Real-World Testing** (next):
1. Test on actual RNA-seq data with known fusions
2. Benchmark performance (time, memory)
3. Validate output against STAR
4. Measure accuracy on fusion detection

**B: Phase 13 - Performance Optimization** (after testing):
1. Profile to identify bottlenecks
2. Optimize seed search, DP stitching, or I/O
3. Validate correctness maintained
